# tf.keras-vggface

Here you can find the modl from rcmalli converted to tf.keras. 
Original: https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface

Install via:

pip install git+https://github.com/JanderHungrige/tf.keras-vggface 


import like this:

from keras_vggface_TF.vggfaceTF import VGGFace
from keras_vggface_TF import utils

If pretrained weigths are used, the weigths are automatically downloaded from rcmalli (links included in utils.py). 
weight for quantisation aware training will be uploaded by me in time.
